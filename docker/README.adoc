= Docker aliases and functions

This is a set of common used aliases and functions that I use with docker.

To use it, just source this file in your .bashrc or .bash_aliases


----
# Docker aliases and functions.
#
# source this script and then use any of the available functions
#
# every function should:
#   - provide a description message with -?
#   - validate correct number of params and constraints
#   - have a description of what it does after the function name. Braces should be on the following line
